-- Missing series labeled Tier 1 in metadata ---
Series 972: not in reduced data; spreadsheet: "Data HDD stopped working // Data to be checked"
Series 1013: not in reduced data; spreadsheet: "DAQ computer restarted at 19.00 !!! Then slow : only 28 runs â€¦ then shutdown"
Series 1257: not in spreadsheet or reduced data
